# Arkestro frontend

An aplication that allows a user to login/signup to a web application where a logged in user can view a table for projects data(that includes tasks and subtasks) that contains a list of deeply nested serialized projects records where various attributes on those records can be updated and persisted to the database.

## Features available
1. Login/Signup to application
2. View list of nested serialized projects table data with tasks and subtasks information
3. Server side pagination of table
4. Logout feature

To start the project just run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
